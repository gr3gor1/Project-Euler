/*
Description: Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, 
            there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

            How many such routes are there through a given gridSize?

Examples:
    latticePaths(4) should return 70.
    latticePaths(9) should return 48620.
    latticePaths(20) should return 137846528820.
